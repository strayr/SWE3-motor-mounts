# SWE3-motor-mounts
More durable motor mounts for Ender3 -> Switchwire conversion based on yenda and TaffoFox's mods

There is an M5x10 BHCS to secure the mount to the Z frame to prevent misalignment, and an M3x30 screws and heatset to joining hte mounts below the adjuster.

This should fit completely with the stock enclosure cutouts.
